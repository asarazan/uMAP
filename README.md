# uMAP
#:: The Plan ::
uMAP (untitled music aggregation project) is an experiment in combining APIs for discogs.com and gemm.com, in an attempt to make it even easier for people to keep track of their record collections, wishlists, and purchase music from independent record stores.

#:: The Stretch Goal ::
If that goes well, and things come together nicely, I will implement a stand-alone music player that is specifically designed with the audiophile in mind, based on the basic functionality of Winamp + the best seekbar behavior this side of the Pecos. Jogwheel would also be pretty sweet. Will possibly tap into Spotify, Pandora, PlayMusic, GrooveShark and other APIs if allowed.
